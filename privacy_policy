Privacy Policy for Yesterday Phone
Last updated: 2025-12-25

This Privacy Policy describes how Yesterday Phone ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our mobile application (the "App").

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy details the permissions we request and how they are used to provide the App's core functionality.

1. Information Collection and Use
The App requires specific permissions to function effectively. Below is a detailed explanation of the data we access and why:

A. App Usage Data (Usage Stats)
Permission: android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS (Usage Access) & android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES
Purpose: The core feature of Yesterday Phone is to provide you with insights into your digital habits, specifically comparing your phone usage "Today" vs. "Yesterday".
Data Collected: We access your device's usage history to calculate:
Total screen time involved.
Time spent in specific applications.
Number of times the device was unlocked.
Privacy: This data is processed locally on your device. We do not transmit your personal app usage history to any external server. It is strictly used to display your dashboard insights.
B. Physical Activity (Step Counter)
Permission: android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION & com.google.android.gms.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION
Purpose: To track your daily steps and physical activity levels as part of your "Morning Mirror" summary.
Data Collected: Step counts and basic activity type (walking).
Privacy: This data remains local to your device and is used solely for the "Steps" metric on your dashboard.
C. Notifications
Permission: android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS
Purpose: To send you the daily "Morning Mirror" summary (a notification that prompts you to review yesterday's stats) and alerts related to service functionality.
D. Background Processing
Permissions: FOREGROUND_SERVICE, FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC, RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED, WAKE_LOCK
Purpose: These permissions allow the App to verify your usage data and schedule correctly timed notifications (such as the morning summary) even if you haven't opened the App recently. The "Data Sync" type is used to ensure your usage statistics are up-to-date in the background.
